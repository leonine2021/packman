# Packman Factory
This project is a mini game of a packman factory

Click "Add Packman" button to create a packman instance, you can create as many packmen as you like.
Click "Start Game", you will see all packmen moving randomly across the screen. When a packman hit the boundary of the viewport, he'll bounce back and change orientation.
You can add more packmen as the game playing.

Potential future development:
  1) Adding a "clear" button to clear the viewport
  2) Add random rotation to packmen
  3) Add road blocks in the viewport so when a packman hit the road block, it will change moving speed or direction
